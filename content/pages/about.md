I love software architecture, fixing problems, and writing code for other people. My experience is in building distributed applications, DevSecOps automation, site reliability engineering, and developer tooling in the defense industry. My current focus is on how software organizations scale, from both thea technical and non-technical perspective. I also once made it to Masters division in StarCraft 2.
