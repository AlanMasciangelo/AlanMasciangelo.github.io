I'm a full stack developer with experience building distributed cloud applications, DevSecOps automation, and developer tooling in the defense industry. My current focus is on scaling software organizations from the bottom-up through DevSecOps best practices and principles. I once made it to Masters division in StarCraft 2 so I'm kind of a big deal.
